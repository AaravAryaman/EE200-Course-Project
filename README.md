Image Fusion (Mixer): Fused two images by combining low-frequency components (structure) of one with high-frequency components
(texture) of another using 2D Fourier Transforms and Gaussian filters.  
Audio Restoration (De-mixer): Surgically removed unwanted instrumental noise from an audio track by designing and cascading high-order
band-stop filters based on frequency analysis.  
Utilized Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots and Spectrograms to analyze signals and isolate target frequencies.
